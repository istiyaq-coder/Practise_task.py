Create a program to find max and min number in the list

student_scores = input("Input a list of students scores ").split()
for n in range(0,len(student_scores)):
    student_scores[n] = int(student_scores[n])
print(student_scores)

print(max(student_scores))
print(min(student_scores))

max_score = 0
for score in student_scores :
    if score > max_score :
        max_score = score

print({f"The highest scorer in the class is :{max_score}"})



min_score = student_scores[0]  # Start with the first score
for score in student_scores:
    if score < min_score:
        min_score = score

print(f"The lowest scorer in the class is: {min_score}")
